# ICM 2016 Schedule

Each section of ICM meets for 14 sessions.  However, in order to stagger final presentations (one week before physical computing), there will be one extra meeting during week 5.  On Friday, October 7th, all classes will meet together for one larger "synthesis" workshop.  The class will meet from **TBA**.
